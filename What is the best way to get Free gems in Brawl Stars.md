    Brawl Pass: If you opt for the Brawl Pass, you can unlock gems by completing tiers in both the free and premium tracks.

    Special offers: Keep an eye on special sales or promotions in the game. Supercell occasionally offers gem bundles at discounted prices or special deals.

    Seasonal Events and Challenges: Participate in events and complete challenges or milestones, as some of these will reward you with gems.

2. How does the Brawl Pass work for gems?

The Brawl Pass is one of the best ways to earn gems:

    The free track of the Brawl Pass gives you rewards like coins, brawlers, and sometimes gems.

    The premium track (paid version) gives even more gems, along with additional rewards like skins and brawler upgrades.

3. Can I earn gems for free in Brawl Stars without paying?

While you can't earn gems quickly for free, there are several ways to get small amounts without spending money:

    Brawl Pass (free tier): The free tier of the Brawl Pass has some gem rewards.

    Seasonal events and challenges: Participating in limited-time events and challenges may provide gems as rewards.

    Special in-game events: Occasionally, there are in-game events or promotions that reward you with free gems for completing tasks or milestones.

4. Can I get gems by watching ads or completing surveys?

Currently, Brawl Stars doesn't offer a system where you can earn gems by watching ads or completing surveys. This is mainly to avoid abuse of such systems. Most of the free gems are earned through event participation or as part of the Brawl Pass rewards.
5. Are there any ways to get more gems during special promotions?

Yes, Supercell occasionally runs special promotions where you can earn more gems or get better value for your money. This could be in the form of:

    Gem bundles on sale: Discounts on gem packs or extra gems for the same price.

    Holiday or event-themed promotions: Special events around holidays where extra gems are included in certain offers.

6. Is it safe to use third-party websites to get free gems?

No, using third-party websites or services that claim to offer free gems is extremely risky and against the gameâ€™s terms of service. These can often be scams that steal your personal information or lead to account bans.
7. Can I get gems for free by inviting friends?

Occasionally, there might be special promotions where you can earn gems by referring or inviting friends to join the game. However, this is typically a limited-time offer, so check the news section in the game for any active referral bonuses or rewards.
8. How often do new gem rewards appear in Brawl Stars?

Gem rewards can be found in seasonal events, limited-time challenges, and Brawl Pass tiers. While these rewards aren't constant, they appear frequently enough that you can accumulate a decent amount of gems over time by participating in events and completing challenges.
9. Can I transfer gems between devices?

Yes, as long as you link your Brawl Stars account to either your Google Play or Apple ID account, your gems and progress will sync across different devices. However, gems themselves cannot be transferred between accounts.
10. Do I get free gems when leveling up or progressing in the game?

Yes, sometimes when you level up your Brawler's Power or account level, you might get a few gems as part of your rewards. However, this is not as common or reliable as the other methods like Brawl Pass or purchasing gems.
11. Is there any way to get gems without spending money but also without waiting too long?

Earning gems without spending money or waiting too long requires active participation in events, challenges, and unlocking rewards from the Brawl Pass. While it might take some time to accumulate a significant number of gems, engaging with the game's events and progressing through the Brawl Pass is the fastest way without spending real money.
12. What are the risks of trying to hack or cheat to get gems?

Attempting to cheat or hack your way to gems can result in:

    Account suspension or permanent ban.

    Loss of personal information.

    Security risks: External apps or websites can steal your account credentials and data. It's best to stick with legitimate methods to avoid these risks.

Always stay within the official methods provided by the game to ensure your account remains safe!
