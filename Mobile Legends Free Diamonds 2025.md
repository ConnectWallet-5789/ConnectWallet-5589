3. Create and Share Mobile Legends Content: If you're active on platforms like YouTube, Twitch, or TikTok, creating Mobile Legends content can be rewarding. Moonton supports content creators, and through their Creator Program, you might receive Diamonds for your contributions. This includes streaming gameplay, producing tutorials, or sharing highlights. ​


4. Participate in Lucky Spin and Magic Wheel Events: Occasionally, Mobile Legends offers Lucky Spin and Magic Wheel events where players can win various prizes, including Diamonds. While these events don't always guarantee Diamonds, they provide opportunities to earn valuable rewards that enhance your gaming experience.​


5. Join Official Communities and Social Media Groups: Being part of official Mobile Legends communities, such as their Facebook groups or Discord server, can alert you to giveaways and special promotions. For instance, community members have reported receiving free Diamonds through official giveaways and contests. ​


Important Considerations:

    Avoid Third-Party Apps and Hacks: Be cautious of third-party applications or websites that claim to offer free Diamonds. Many are scams designed to steal personal information or compromise your account's security. Using unauthorized methods can lead to account suspension or permanent bans. ​
 
  

    Stay Informed: Regularly follow Mobile Legends' official channels to stay updated on legitimate opportunities to earn Diamonds. This includes subscribing to their YouTube channel, following their Facebook page, and joining their Discord server.​

Remember, while free Diamonds are obtainable, they require active participation in the game's community and events. Always prioritize methods endorsed by Moonton to ensure a safe and enjoyable gaming experience.
